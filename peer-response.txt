1.One of the things I might suggest on the artist CV page where you're displaying your paintings is to give them a contrasting border know that they stand out a little bit more.
    I added a black solid border around each individual image on that "Artist CV" page only. I wanted to keep the photos on the other pages clean and simple with rounded edges. 

3.I noticed in your footer you have your website and Instagram name titled at the bottom but they are not in the form of a link i would highly recommend making them an accessible link people can click on.
    Good suggestion. I added a clickable link on every page that direct users to my website and my instagram page. 

4.The few changes I would suggest is changing the left-margin to 5% in the media query for #artistcvgrid, #paintandpartygrid, and #photographygrid.  Changing the margin centered the images more inline with the nav menu and text box above.  
    This was vey helpful because I couldnt find the right percentage that would center my images while in mobile. I added a margin-left: 5% at the max-width:850px media query for each grid.

5. Also, the header#profilepic>img in portfolio.css margin-right could be reduced so that the image doesn't overlap with the image on the left. 
    I didnt ntice this, so good catch. I changed the margin-right from 10% to 5%.
