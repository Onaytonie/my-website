        I created the Paint and Party class as a space for people to connect with their imagination, let go of daily
        struggles, and embrace the freedom of creating without limitations. Its not just about painting, it's about
        experiencing mental silence, focusing only on the art, and allowing creativity to flow while enjoying good music
        and a light, uplifting atmosphere. The idea was born from my time in Japan, where a language barrier showed me
        that art speaks louder than words. This class is for everyone- every race, age, and gender-because creativity
        knows no boundaries.
