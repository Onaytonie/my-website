        I created the Paint and Party class as a space for people to connect with their imagination, let go of daily struggles, and embrace the freedom of creating without limitations. Its not just about painting, it's about experiencing mental silence, focusing only on the art, and allowing creativity to flow while enjoying good music and a light, uplifting atmosphere. The idea was born from my time in Japan, where a language barrier showed me that art speaks louder than words. This class is for everyone- every race, age, and gender-because creativity knows no boundaries.
