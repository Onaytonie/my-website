    <h1>BRAND STORY</h1>
    <h4>Southside. Bainbridge. Richmond, VA</h4>
    <br>
    <article id="brandstory">
        <p>Growing up in Southside Richmond, Virginia, I wasn't surrounded by art, nor did I take any formal art
            classes. However, my imagination was always vivid and untamed. As a child, I cherished moments sitting
            beside my grandmother in church, drawing and coloring to avoid Sunday school. These creative sessions
            were my sanctuary,rewarded with a piece of her Winterfresh gum and an original piece of artwork to take
            home.</p>
        <p>Years later, I matured, standing tall at six feet, I found it challenging to discover fashion that
            resonated with my personality. This led me to hand-paint my clothing, transforming them into unique
            expressions of self. What began as a personal endeavor soon blossomed into a side hustle, designing
            custom apparel and tote bags for others on my mom's dining room table on Hargrove Street.</p>
        <p>My artistic journey took a profound turn when I discovered canvas and acrylics; they captivated me and
            have held my heart ever since. The moment i picked up a brush, I felt an instant connection- one that
            has only deepened over the years. From painting Muhammad Ali to cows, Kobe braynt to florals, my
            creativity knows no bounds. As my skills evolved, so did the scope of my ommissions, expanding in ways I
            never imagined.</p>
        <p>Ive been fortunate to see my art find homes across the world- Bahrain, Dubai, Japan, Puerto Rico, 30
            states, and beyond. And as my brushstrokes extend across canvas, they now flow onto fabric as well. My
            artwork lives not only on walls but also in motion, carried by those who wear my designs, allowing my
            creations to travel even further.</p>
        <p>Living in Japan presented an opportunity to bridge cultural and language barriers by teaching paint
            classes. Through these sessions, I connected with others, proving that art is a universal language. I am
            passionate about all forms of art, both digital and physical. Studying the great artists allows me
            to explore and experiment with various styles, continually evolving my creative expression. In essence, I'm
            just a girl from Southside who loves to create. My journey is a testament to the power of
            imagination and the beauty of embracing one's unique path.</p>
