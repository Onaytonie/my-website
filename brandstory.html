            <h1>Southide Richmond</h1>
            <p>Growing up in Southside Richmond, Virginia, I wasn't surrounded by art, nor did I take any formal art
                classes.
                However, my imagination was always vivid and untamed. As a child, I cherished moments sitting beside my
                grandmother in church, drawing and coloring to avoid Sunday school. These creative sessions were my
                sanctuary,
                rewarded with a piece of her Winterfresh gum and the comfort of being nestled under her arm.</p>
            <p>I matured, standing tall at six feet, I found it challenging to discover fashion that resonated with my
                personality. This led me to hand-paint my clothing, transforming them into unique expressions of self.
                What
                began as a personal endeavor soon blossomed into a side hustle, designing custom apparel and tote bags
                for
                others on my mom's dining room table.</p>
            <p>My artistic journey took a profound turn when I discovered canvas and acrylics; they captivated me and
                have
                held
                my heart ever since. Living in Japan presented an opportunity to bridge cultural and language barriers
                by
                teaching paint classes. Through these sessions, I connected with others, proving that art is a universal
                language.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about all forms of art, both digital and physical. Studying the great artists allows me
                to
                explore and experiment with various styles, continually evolving my creative expression. In essence, I'm
                just a girl from Southside who loves to create. My journey is a testament to the power of
                imagination and the beauty of embracing one's unique path.</p>
